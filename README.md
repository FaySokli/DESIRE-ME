# DESIRE-ME: Domain-Enhanced Supervised Information REtrieval using Mixture-of-Experts

Abstract:
Open-domain question answering requires retrieval systems able to cope with the diverse and varied nature of questions, providing accurate answers across a broad spectrum of query types and topics. To deal with such topic heterogeneity, we propose DESIRE-ME, an adaptive neural information retrieval model leveraging the Mixture-of-Experts framework to combine multiple specialized neural models. We rely on Wikipedia data to train an effective neural gating mechanism that combines the predictions of the different domain-specific experts, allowing DESIRE-ME to specialize in multiple domains. Through extensive experiments on three different publicly available datasets, we show that our proposal is able to effectively generalize domain-enhanced neural models. In fact, DESIRE-ME excels in handling open-domain questions: in term of NDCG@10, DESIRE-ME outperforms by up to 5% the state-of-the-art monolithic architectures trained on the same corpora.

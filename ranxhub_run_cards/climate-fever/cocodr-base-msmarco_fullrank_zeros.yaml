model:
  name: cocodr-base-msmarco
  description: "This model has been first pretrained on the BEIR corpus and fine-tuned on MS MARCO dataset following the approach described in the paper COCO-DR: Combating Distribution Shifts in Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval with Contrastive and Distributionally Robust Learning. The associated GitHub repository is available here https://github.com/OpenMatch/COCO-DR. This model is trained with BERT-base as the backbone with 110M hyperparameters. See the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15212 for details."
